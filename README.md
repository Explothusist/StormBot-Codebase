# WPILib Imitation

Under src/FRCLib, there is a partial imitation of the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) robot control library WPILib, an open source library built and maintained by the Worchester Polytechnic Institute. WPILib's most outstanding benefit is its simple and efficient command-based robot framework dividing the robot into commands and subsystems. This imitation library provides most of the basic functionality of WPILib to VEX and Esp32 architectures.
